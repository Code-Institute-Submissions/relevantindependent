Relevant Independent README.


Synopsis:
I wanted to make a website containing news and reviews for independent video games. The code will allow users to view reviews, and register on a mailing list.


Getting the code up and running:
    1) Firstly you will need to clone this repository by running the git clone <project's Github URL> command

    2) After you've that you'll need to make sure that you have npm installed
    
    3) You can get npm by installing Node from here: https://nodejs.org/en/
    
    4) After those dependencies have been installed you'll need to make sure that you have http-server installed. You can install this by running the following: npm install -g http-server # this also may require sudo on Mac/Linux

    5) Once http-server is installed run http-server -c-1
    
    6) The project will now run on localhost: http://127.0.0.1:8080/

    7) Make changes to the code and if you think it belongs in here then just submit a pull request
